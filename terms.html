<br><br>
These terms of use ("Terms") apply to your access and use of BeKind (the "Service"). Please read them carefully.
<br><br>

<strong>Accepting these Terms</strong>
<br><br>
If you access or use the Service, it means you agree to be bound by all of the terms below. So, before you use the Service, please read all of the terms. If you do not agree to all of the terms, please do not use the Service. 
<br>
<ul>
<li>You agree that you are over 13 years old. If you are between 13 and 18 years old, you need to review and agree by your legal guardian (such as parents). </li>
<li>BeKind is not responsible for the actions of its users or your interactions with them. We do not conduct background checks. There is no guarantee that neighbors, people in your community, strangers, and BeKind users are good, kind, and loving people. </li>
<li>Be careful with interacting with people on or off of BeKind. If you are between 13 and 18 years old, you need to inform your legal guardian about every kind act you are planning to perform. </li>
<li>If a term does not make sense to you, please let us know.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Changes to these Terms</strong>
<br><br>
We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. For instance, we may need to change these Terms if we come out with a new feature or for some other reason. Whenever we make changes to these Terms, the changes are effective immediately after we post such revised Terms (indicated by revising the date at the top of these Terms) or upon your acceptance if we provide a mechanism for your immediate acceptance of the revised Terms (such as a click-through confirmation or acceptance button). It is your responsibility to check BeKind for changes to these Terms. If you continue to use the Service after the revised Terms go into effect, then you have accepted the changes to these Terms.
<br><br>
<strong>Third-Party Services</strong>
<br><br>
From time to time, we may provide you with links to third-party websites or services that we do not own or control. Your use of the Service may also include the use of applications that are developed or owned by a third-party. Your use of such third-party applications, websites, and services is governed by that party's own terms of service or privacy policies. We encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of any third-party application, website or service that you visit or use.
<br><br>
<strong>Accounts</strong>
<br><br>
When you create an account or use another service to log into the Service, you agree to maintain the security of your password and accept all risks of unauthorized access to any data or other information you provide to the Service. You understand that if you delete your account, or if we delete your account in accordance with these terms, you may lose access to any data previously associated with your account (including, without limitation, the level or points you have reached). You acknowledge and agree that you shall have no ownership or other property interest in any account that you create using any of our services. We may suspend, terminate, modify or delete any of these accounts at any time for any reason or no reason, with or without notice to you. If you discover or suspect any Service security breaches, please let us know immediately.
<br><br>
The Service is also a platform where organizations can release their own apps. If you use these apps, your account will be shared between the Service and the organization.
<br><br>

We may format your content for display throughout the Service, but we will not edit or revise the substance of the content itself. Aside from our limited right to your content, you retain all of your rights to the content you post, link and otherwise make available on or through the Service. You can remove the content that you posted by deleting it. Once you delete your content, it will not appear on the Service, but copies of your deleted content may remain in our system or backups for some period of time. We will retain web server access logs and then delete them.
<br><br>

<li>Private information of any third-party (e.g. addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, Social Security numbers and credit card numbers); and</li>
<li>Viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files or code.</li>
</ul>
Also, you agree that you will not do any of the following in connection with the Service or other users:
<br>

<strong>Intellectual Property</strong>
<br><br>
We put a lot of effort into creating the Service including, the logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information and other content (excluding your content).

When you leave the Service, you should be aware that these Terms and our policies no longer govern. If there is any content on the Service from you and others, we don't review, verify or authenticate it, and it may include inaccuracies or false information. We make no representations, warranties, or guarantees relating to the quality, suitability, truth, accuracy or completeness of any content contained in the Service.

<br><br>
Beta Testers are occasionally invited to help test our Service or new features within the Service, identified as “beta” or “pre-release” or words or phrases with similar meanings (the “Beta Product”).

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO THE SERVICE. THIS SECTION WILL BE GIVEN FULL EFFECT EVEN IF ANY REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT IS DEEMED TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys' fees, costs, penalties, interest and disbursements) we incur in relation to, arising from, or for the purpose of avoiding, any claim or demand from a third party relating to your use of the Service or the use of the Service by any person using your account, including any claim that your use of the Service violates any applicable law or regulation, or the rights of any third party, and/or your violation of these Terms.
<br><br>
